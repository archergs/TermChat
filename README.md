# TermChat
TermChat is a simple messaging client that lives in your terminal. It's purpose is to chat with other users on the same local network as you. You can choose to either act as a host or client, where the client enters the IP of the host to initiate the chat. 

## Setup
To setup, create a virtual environment in the root of the project
`python3 -m venv .venv`
Then enter the newly created environment 
`source .venv/bin/activate`
While TermChat doesn't have any strict dependencies pertaining to its function, if you plan to contribute to the project I recommend installing them anyway
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
